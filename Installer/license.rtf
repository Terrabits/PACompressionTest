\fs28 Terms and Conditions for royalty-free Products\par
\fs24 ROHDE & SCHWARZ GMBH & CO. KG, MUEHLDORFSTRASSE 15, 81671 MUNICH, GERMANY\b0\par
July 2019\par
\b Legal Notice:\b0  Please read these terms and conditions before downloading, installing or otherwise using the royalty-free software programmes, beta release programmes, accompanying documentation, Apps (applications for mobile devices), method descriptions, pictures, graphs, interfaces, databases and other information or contents provided by Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co.\f1\~KG free of charge (hereinafter referred to as \ldblquote Product\rdblquote  or \ldblquote Products\rdblquote ). All use of the Product is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below (hereinafter referred to as \ldblquote Terms and Conditions\rdblquote ).\par
\f0 To install the product, the User must first agree to the Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms and Conditions, installing or otherwise using any of the Product indicates the User\rquote s acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.\par
\b 1. Scope of these Terms and Conditions\par
\b0 The User shall be entitled to view and download the Product including enhancements and documentations if any. The use of the Product shall be free of charge. The right to use the Product requires the prior acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.\par
If and to the extent the Product is provided to the User by ROHDE & SCHWARZ GmbH & Co.\f1\~KG (hereinafter referred to as \ldblquote R&S\rdblquote ) in order to fulfil R&S\rquote  warranty or non gratuitous maintenance obligations under any other already existing agreement with the User, the use of the Product shall be governed by such other agreement.\par
\b\f0 2. Grant of License\par
\b0 R&S grants to the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty free, perpetual right to use the Product for the sole purpose for which it is intended and provided by R&S.\par
The license granted hereunder is limited to R&S and R&S licensors\rquote  intellectual property rights in the Product. R&S reserves all rights not expressly granted hereunder to the User.\par
\b 3. Restrictions\par
\b0 The User shall not (i) copy the Product except for archival purposes or unless it is essentially required for its authorized use, (ii) modify, adapt or create derivative works of the Product or disable any of its features, (iii) remove, alter or obscure any product identification, copyright or other intellectual property notices embedded within or on the Product, or (iv) publish, disclose, sell, rent, lease, lend, distribute, make available online, sublicense or provide the Product to any third party without R&S\rquote  prior written consent. The User shall not decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Product unless stipulated otherwise by mandatory law.\par
\b 4. Third Party Product / Open Source Software\par
\b0 To the extent that the Product is provided to the User for which R&S has only derived rights to use (Third Party Product), the above Sections \ldblquote Grant of License\rdblquote  and \ldblquote Restrictions\rdblquote  shall \endash  also concerning the relationship between R&S and the User \endash  be amended and superseded by the conditions of use agreed between R&S and its licensor. To the extent that the User is provided with Open Source Software, the provisions of the above Sections \ldblquote Grant of License\rdblquote  and \ldblquote Restrictions\rdblquote  shall be amended and superseded by the conditions of use of the according Open Source Software. Upon request, R&S shall provide the User with the source code if the provision of the source code has been agreed in the conditions of use of the Open Source Software licence. R&S shall point out in the contract documents or in any other appropriate document if Third Party Products (including, but not limited to Open Source Software) and pertaining conditions of use exist and shall make the conditions of use available if so requested by the User. Any breach of the conditions of use on the part of the User shall entitle not only R&S, but also its licensor, to assert claims and rights arising there from in their own name.\par
\b 5. Copyright and Authorised Licensor\par
\b0 Subject to the following sentence R&S is and will remain the sole owner of all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Product, and all modifications, enhancements, updates, upgrades and derivative works thereof made by R&S. To the extent the Product contains a Third Party Product R&S is entitled to grant or forward to the User the license as set forth in these Terms and Conditions.\par
The User must reproduce all copyright notices in the original Product on all permitted copies.\par
\b 6. Limitation of Warranty\par
\b0 The Product shall be made available to the User free of charge. R&S shall in particular make no warranty or representation that any Product will meet the User\rquote s expectations, requirements or works in combination with any hardware or applications software provided by third parties, that the operation of the Product will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that any defects in any Product will be corrected. Furthermore, R&S shall make no warranty that the Product is free from any third-party rights. The aforementioned exclusion of warranty shall not apply if and to the extent R&S fraudulently conceals a defect of title or material defect of the Product, in which case R&S shall be obliged to indemnify the User for damages resulting therefrom.\par
\b 7. Product Support\par
\b0 R&S offers a limited support for the Product at its sole discretion on voluntary basis and reserves the right to update the contents of the Product and its associated programs, files, documentation and/or other elements.\par
\b 8. Liability\par
\b0 R&S shall only be liable in case of intent and only up to a maximum of EUR 500 in aggregate. These limitations shall not apply in case of injuries of life, body or health. Mandatory liability pursuant to product liability law shall remain unaffected.\par
\b 9. Indirect and Consequential Damages\par
\b0 In no event shall R&S be liable for (i) any indirect, consequential or economic damages, and (ii) loss of profit, risk/replacement purchase, interruption of business, loss of production, contractual claims of third parties, loss of data due to a software error and loss of interest.\par
\b 10. Export Control, embargos and sanctions\par
\b0 The User shall comply with all export control, embargo and sanctions laws and regulations, which are applicable to the Product and the User; this includes without being limited to restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. In addition, the User represents and warrants that it is not named on any applicable official sanction list (including without being limited to any governmental list of persons, organizations or entities that are prohibited from receiving exports, re-exports or other transfers) and that no competent public authority has suspended, revoked or denied the User\rquote s export privileges.\par
\b 11. Revocation\par
\b0 R&S may revoke the License upon notice for failure of the User to comply with any of these Terms and Conditions. Upon revocation, the User shall immediately stop the use and immediately return or destroy the Product, together with all copies, adaptations and merged portions in any form. In case of destruction the User shall prove such destruction if requested by R&S.\par
\b 12. Applicable Law / Place of Jurisdiction\par
\b0 These Terms and Conditions and the contractual relationship between the User and R&S shall be governed by German law, excluding the provisions on conflict of laws. The application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall be excluded.\par
The courts of Munich shall have exclusive jurisdiction in case of any disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship, provided that the User is a businessman, a body corporate, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law. R&S shall also have the right to take legal actions at the User\rquote s domicile.\par
\b 13. Miscellaneous\par
\b0 If any provision of these Terms and Conditions are held invalid, the of- fending clause will be modified so as to be enforceable and, as modified, shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of these Terms and Condi- tions will continue in full force and effect.\par

impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit\par
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So\par
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\par
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\par
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\par
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\par
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\par

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
        Preamble\par
\par
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\par
software and other kinds of works.\par
\par
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\par
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\par
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\par
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\par
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\par
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\par
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\par
your programs, too.\par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\par
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\par
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\par
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\par
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\par
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\par
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\par
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\par
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\par
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\par
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\par
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\par
know their rights.\par
\par
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\par
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\par
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\par
\par
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\par
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\par
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\par
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\par
authors of previous versions.\par
\par
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\par
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\par
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\par
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\par
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\par
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\par
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\par
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\par
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\par
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\par
\par
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\par
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\par
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\par
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\par
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\par
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.\par
\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
0. Definitions.\par
\par
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\par
\par
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\par
works, such as semiconductor masks.\par
\par
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\par
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\par
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\par
\par
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\par
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\par
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\par
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\par
\par
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\par
on the Program.\par
\par
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\par
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\par
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\par
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\par
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\par
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\par
\par
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\par
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\par
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\par
\par
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\par
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\par
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\par
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\par
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\par
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\par
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\par
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\par
\par
1. Source Code.\par
\par
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\par
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\par
form of a work.\par
\par
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\par
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\par
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\par
is widely used among developers working in that language.\par
\par
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\par
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\par
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\par
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\par
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\par
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\par
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\par
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\par
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\par
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\par
\par
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\par
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\par
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\par
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\par
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\par
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\par
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\par
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\par
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\par
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\par
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\par
subprograms and other parts of the work.\par
\par
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\par
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\par
Source.\par
\par
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\par
same work.\par
\par
2. Basic Permissions.\par
\par
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\par
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\par
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\par
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\par
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\par
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\par
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\par
\par
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\par
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\par
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\par
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\par
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\par
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\par
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\par
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\par
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\par
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\par
\par
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\par
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\par
makes it unnecessary.\par
\par
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\par
\par
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\par
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\par
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\par
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\par
measures.\par
\par
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\par
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\par
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\par
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\par
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\par
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\par
technological measures.\par
\par
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\par
\par
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\par
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\par
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\par
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\par
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\par
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\par
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\par
\par
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\par
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\par
\par
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\par
\par
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\par
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\par
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\par
it, and giving a relevant date.\par
\par
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\par
released under this License and any conditions added under section\par
7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\par
"keep intact all notices".\par
\par
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\par
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\par
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\par
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\par
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\par
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\par
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\par
\par
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\par
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\par
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\par
work need not make them do so.\par
\par
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\par
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\par
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\par
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\par
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\par
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\par
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\par
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\par
parts of the aggregate.\par
\par
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\par
\par
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\par
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\par
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\par
in one of these ways:\par
\par
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\par
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\par
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\par
customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\par
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\par
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\par
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\par
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\par
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\par
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\par
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\par
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\par
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\par
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\par
\par
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\par
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\par
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\par
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\par
with subsection 6b.\par
\par
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\par
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\par
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\par
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\par
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\par
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\par
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\par
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\par
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\par
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\par
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\par
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\par
\par
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\par
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\par
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\par
charge under subsection 6d.\par
\par
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\par
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\par
included in conveying the object code work.\par
\par
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\par
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\par
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\par
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\par
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\par
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\par
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\par
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\par
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\par
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\par
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\par
the only significant mode of use of the product.\par
\par
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\par
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\par
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\par
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\par
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\par
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\par
modification has been made.\par
\par
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\par
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\par
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\par
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\par
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\par
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\par
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\par
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\par
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\par
been installed in ROM).\par
\par
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\par
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\par
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\par
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\par
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\par
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\par
protocols for communication across the network.\par
\par
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\par
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\par
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\par
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\par
unpacking, reading or copying.\par
\par
7. Additional Terms.\par
\par
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\par
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\par
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\par
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\par
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\par
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\par
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\par
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\par
\par
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\par
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\par
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\par
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\par
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\par
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\par
\par
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\par
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\par
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\par
\par
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\par
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\par
\par
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\par
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\par
Notices displayed by works containing it; or\par
\par
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\par
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\par
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\par
\par
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\par
authors of the material; or\par
\par
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\par
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\par
\par
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\par
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\par
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\par
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\par
those licensors and authors.\par
\par
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\par
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\par
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\par
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\par
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\par
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\par
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\par
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\par
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\par
\par
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\par
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\par
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\par
where to find the applicable terms.\par
\par
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\par
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\par
the above requirements apply either way.\par
\par
8. Termination.\par
\par
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\par
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\par
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\par
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\par
paragraph of section 11).\par
\par
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\par
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\par
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\par
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\par
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\par
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\par
\par
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\par
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\par
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\par
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\par
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\par
your receipt of the notice.\par
\par
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\par
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\par
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\par
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\par
material under section 10.\par
\par
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\par
\par
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\par
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\par
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\par
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\par
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\par
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\par
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\par
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\par
\par
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\par
\par
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\par
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\par
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\par
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\par
\par
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\par
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\par
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\par
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\par
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\par
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\par
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\par
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\par
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\par
\par
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\par
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\par
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\par
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\par
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\par
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\par
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\par
\par
11. Patents.\par
\par
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\par
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\par
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\par
\par
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\par
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\par
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\par
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\par
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\par
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\par
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\par
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\par
this License.\par
\par
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\par
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\par
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\par
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\par
\par
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\par
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\par
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\par
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\par
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\par
patent against the party.\par
\par
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\par
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\par
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\par
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\par
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\par
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\par
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\par
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\par
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\par
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\par
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\par
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\par
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\par
\par
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\par
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\par
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\par
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\par
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\par
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\par
work and works based on it.\par
\par
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\par
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\par
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\par
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\par
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\par
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\par
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\par
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\par
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\par
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\par
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\par
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\par
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\par
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\par
\par
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\par
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\par
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\par
\par
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\par
\par
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\par
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\par
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\par
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\par
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\par
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\par
\par
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\par
\par
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\par
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\par
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\par
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\par
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\par
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\par
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\par
combination as such.\par
\par
14. Revised Versions of this License.\par
\par
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\par
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\par
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\par
address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\par
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\par
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\par
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\par
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\par
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\par
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\par
by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\par
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\par
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\par
to choose that version for the Program.\par
\par
Later license versions may give you additional or different\par
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\par
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\par
later version.\par
\par
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\par
\par
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\par
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\par
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\par
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\par
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\par
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\par
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
16. Limitation of Liability.\par
\par
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\par
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\par
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\par
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\par
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\par
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\par
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\par
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\par
SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\par
\par
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\par
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\par
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\par
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\par
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\par
copy of the Program in return for a fee.\par
\par
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
\par
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\par
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
\par
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\par
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\par
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\par
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\par
(at your option) any later version.\par
\par
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\par
GNU General Public License for more details.\par
\par
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\par
along with this program.  If not, see <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\par
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\par
<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\par
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\par
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\par
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.\par
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\par
<{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\par
\par
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\par
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\par
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\par

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\par
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
 the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
                            Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\par
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\par
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\par
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\par
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\par
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\par
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\par
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\par
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\par
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\par
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\par
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\par
these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\par
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\par
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\par
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\par
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\par
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\par
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\par
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\par
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\par
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\par
introduced by others.\par
\page\par
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\par
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\par
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\par
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\par
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\par
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\par
\par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\par
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\par
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\par
libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\par
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\par
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\par
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\par
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\par
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\par
the library.\par
\par
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\par
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\par
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\par
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\par
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\par
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\par
special circumstances.\par
\par
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\par
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\par
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\par
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\par
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\par
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\par
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\par
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\par
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\par
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\par
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\par
system.\par
\par
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\par
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\par
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\par
that program using a modified version of the Library.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\par
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\par
be combined with the library in order to run.\par
\page\par
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\par
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\par
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\par
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\par
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\par
and installation of the library.\par
\par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\par
and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\par
fee.\par
\page\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\par
    its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\par
    root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\par
it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\par
these notices.\par
\page\par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\par
the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\par
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
\page\par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\par
of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\par
    to use the modified definitions.)\par
\par
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\par
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\par
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\par
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\par
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\par
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\par
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\par
\par
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\par
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\par
    specified materials from the same place.\par
\par
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\par
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\par
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\par
the executable.\par
\par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\par
distribute.\par
\page\par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\par
    Sections above.\par
\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\par
this License.\par
\page\par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\par
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\par
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\par
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\par
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\par
written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.\par
\page\par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
                            NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\par
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\par
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\par
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\par
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\par
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\par
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\par
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\par
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\par
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\par
DAMAGES.\par
\par
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\page\par
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\par
\par
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\par
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\par
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\par
ordinary General Public License).\par
\par
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\par
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\par
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\par
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\par
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\par
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\par
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\par

STATIC LINKING EXCEPTION\par
\par
The copyright holders give you permission to link this library with\par
independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license\par
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the\par
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also\par
meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of\par
the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is\par
not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,\par
you must extend this exception to your version of the library.\par

 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
 the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\par
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\par
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\par
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\par
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\par
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\par
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\par
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\par
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\par
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\par
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\par
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\par
these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\par
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\par
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\par
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\par
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\par
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\par
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\par
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\par
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\par
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\par
introduced by others.\par
\page\par
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\par
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\par
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\par
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\par
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\par
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\par
\par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\par
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\par
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\par
libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\par
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\par
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\par
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\par
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\par
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\par
the library.\par
\par
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\par
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\par
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\par
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\par
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\par
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\par
special circumstances.\par
\par
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\par
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\par
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\par
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\par
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\par
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\par
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\par
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\par
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\par
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\par
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\par
system.\par
\par
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\par
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\par
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\par
that program using a modified version of the Library.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\par
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\par
be combined with the library in order to run.\par
\page\par
\tab\tab   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\par
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\par
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\par
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\par
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\par
and installation of the library.\par
\par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\par
and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
  \par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\par
fee.\par
\page\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\par
    its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\par
    root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\par
it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\par
these notices.\par
\page\par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\par
the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\par
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
\page\par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\par
of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\par
    to use the modified definitions.)\par
\par
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\par
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\par
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\par
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\par
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\par
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\par
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\par
\par
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\par
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\par
    specified materials from the same place.\par
\par
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\par
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\par
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\par
the executable.\par
\par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\par
distribute.\par
\page\par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\par
    Sections above.\par
\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\par
this License.\par
\page\par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\par
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\par
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\par
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\par
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\par
written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.\par
\page\par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\par
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\par
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\par
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\par
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\par
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\par
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\par
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\par
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\par
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\par
DAMAGES.\par
