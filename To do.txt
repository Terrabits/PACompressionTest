My to do list:
- Use measured Pin (a1), reinterpolate
* Need to "validate" a1 values; either find a way to read/write them directly without error (formatted [real] values), or validate the conversion calculation that I've been using, perhaps preserve precision somehow (keep as complex?).


- Plots vs Pout (reinterpolated)
- GCA CSV file
- Compact GUI
- Speed Test
  * HiSlip?
  * Concatenate/collapse SCPI commands into fewer statements
