To do:
 - Shrink settings dialog to ZVA screen height
 - "Inner loop" progress bar
 - Update progress plot: increase Pin each sweep UNLESS compression is found
 - Replace linear interpolation with...?
 - Ensure more accurate and/or repeatable results by...?
   * dwell time?
 - Attenuators: Is Pout_compression off? Pin_compression?
 - Display "Port 1 Source" rather than "Channel Base Pb"
   Channel > Mode > Port config > "Stimulus..." > Power: "Enter and Display" > "Port 1 Source"
 - 

===========================================

Still left to do:
- Provide documentation on use
  * Reserved channels, traces
  * Work flow
- Get feedback from AEs, M/A-COM

- Ask about power cal:

Notes from discussion with Volker:
- Power flatness cal at each frequency (cumbersome by hand)
- (Our) ALC may not work with pulsed power
- Zva: Cal -> Enhanced Wave Corrections

Add at least power flatness to measurment!??

Power level of DUT?
- 

Question: Correct bullet/cabling

// Get power corrections:
CORR:POW:DATA? 'BWAV2'

If you have a 0.1 dB bullet, add this to each power correction and rewrite
CORR:POW:DATA 'BWAV2',...

!! Make into separate utility (DONE)
