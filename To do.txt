Still left to do:
- Provide documentation on use
  * Reserved channels, traces
  * Work flow
- Get feedback from AEs, M/A-COM

- Ask about power cal:

Notes from discussion with Volker:
- Power flatness cal at each frequency (cumbersome by hand)
- (Our) ALC may not work with pulsed power
- Zva: Cal -> Enhanced Wave Corrections

Add at least power flatness to measurment!??

Power level of DUT?
- 

Question: Correct bullet/cabling

// Get power corrections:
CORR:POW:DATA? 'BWAV2'

If you have a 0.1 dB bullet, add this to each power correction and rewrite
CORR:POW:DATA 'BWAV2',...

!! Make into separate utility (DONE)
