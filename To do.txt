Things I've done:
 - Renamed Y axis options: S11, S21, S12, S22
 - Assiged data traces to diagrams. It adds clutter, yes, but the trace manager will not let you move the memory trace unless both are assigned (confirmed Jerome's complaint about this)
 - Create plots unit tests
 - Was not able to recreate "bogus" plot
 - Reinterpolate vs Measured Pin, Pout with a greater number of points (no straight lines, missing features?)
 - Added comma to CSV
 - Added Pin phase, Pout phase to CSV
 - When appropriate, channel frequency/power is set to chosen value (displayed X-axis summary)
 - Checks validity of at-value if X, at parameters change
 - Checks validity of at-value when measurement range changes
 - Changing xFreq plot to Pin: trace shows up now
 - Changing xPower to Freq: trace shows up now

 

Note:
 - x-axis does not adjust: Cannot work around this without deleting channel (would lose diagram, trace format, markers etc)
 - Having too many memory traces on-screen slows down subsequent PA Compression Test measurement efforts, to the point where they will time out. Any way to increase memory?


My to do list:
- Plots Testing and improvement
  * Test plotting after range change (x-axis doesn't adjust?)
- CSV File:
  * add settings as header (combine previous files into CSV)
  * Add pulse definition info
- Compact GUI
- Speed Test
  * HiSlip? ZVA DOES NOT SUPPORT!
  * Concatenate/collapse SCPI commands into fewer statements
