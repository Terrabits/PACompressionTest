Greg's requests, summarized:
- See last 2-3 sweeps
- Continuous trace update (Pin, Pout), on VNA screen
- Plot with both Phase vs Pin, Phase vs Pout at compression
- Handle gain expansion (yes)
- Stop power level at compression + 0.25 dBm (yes)
- Measure pulsed RF (yes)


Easy:
- Plot with both Phase vs Pin, Phase vs Pout at compression
- Handle gain expansion

Medium:
- See last 2-3 sweeps
- Continuous trace update (Pin, Pout), on VNA screen

Hard:
- Stop at compression
- Measure pulsed RF


To do by next week:
- Gain expansion
- phase vs Pin, Pout (two traces)
- Plot axis free select
